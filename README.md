The I3D model processes the input frames in two dimensions simultaneously:

Spatial Dimension (Height and Width):

1. It looks at patterns within each frame (e.g., objects, hand positions, body poses).
2. This is done using 2D convolutions across the spatial dimensions (like in image classification models).

Temporal Dimension (Time):
1. It captures patterns across consecutive frames (e.g., motion, interactions).
2. This is done using 3D convolutions, which extend regular 2D convolutions to include the time dimension.
